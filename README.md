- 👋 Hi, I’m @Croissantaye
- 👀 I’m interested in video game programming. Specifically using c# in unity.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to better structure my code to make it more readable and sensible. 
      I'm also learning more about design patterns.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any small projects. I'm well versed in C++, C#, Java, and 
      python. I'm still learning Javascript, but I'd be willing to work on web projects to learn 
      more.
